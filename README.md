# A Fake Spotify - Music Releases ðŸŽµ
First project using JSX and react with JSON Api. Project was to fetch data and show cover albums with links using map.

## The problem

Eslintrc.json file gave us a lot of issues after deleting it and adding it again, in the wrong place, which made deploying impossible. But after relocating the file inde code folder and fixed build command in files it finally worked.

Next would be to fix the space after "," and "&" that are placed between artists instead of solving it with " .".
